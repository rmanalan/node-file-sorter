================

Given a glob of files, sort them into directories ordered by year and month the file was created. I use this order my photo collection.

	Usage: coffee ./sort_by_date_taken.coffee [-d (debug only)] -s [source glob] -t [target dir]

	Options:
	  -s  [required]
	  -t  [required]

	Missing required arguments: s, t
